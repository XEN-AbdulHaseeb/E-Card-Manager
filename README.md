# E-Card Manager
E-Card Manager is an app that generates and sends a customized jpeg of an E-card to an email recipient, the user will use their own email via OAuth 2.0 protocol.

The user will enter the required data into a client, the client will forward the data to a remote server using Socket Programming.

The server will handle the complex operations of generation of the JPEG and scheduling of the email.

# Current Build info

The current build meets the basic specifications I have added additional features namely:

-The ability to choose fonts and templates.

-A preview screen which allows the user to edit the contents of the JPEG in real time, which include text, text size, text color, background, alignment, etc.

-Allow users to upload their own fonts and templates(Backgrounds).

# Issues
-Currently the server program needs to be run locally, running the server program on a global server would be expensive as this project is only a demonstration.

-Full testing and deployment is pending.
